# wealthdata
Projecting US wealth microdata from the Survey of Consumer Finances and other sources.

This Python package imports the latest data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (2016) and Forbes 400 list (2019), and projects it into the future based on trends in household wealth from the quarterly [Federal Reserve National Accounts](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/) (summarized in [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL192090005Q)).

>The Financial Accounts are published four times per year, about 10 weeks following the end of each calendar quarter.
